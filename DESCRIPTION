Description: Computes the posterior model probabilities for four meta-analysis models 
    (null model vs. alternative model assuming either fixed- or random-effects, respectively).
    These posterior probabilities are used to estimate the overall mean effect size 
    as the weighted average of the mean effect size estimates of the random- and 
    fixed-effect model as proposed by Gronau, Van Erp, Heck, Cesario, Jonas, & 
    Wagenmakers (2017, <doi:10.1080/23743603.2017.1326760>). The user can define 
    a wide range of noninformative or informative priors for the mean effect size 
    and the heterogeneity coefficient. Funding for this research was provided by 
    the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences, a program of 
    the Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA), with support from the Laura and 
    John Arnold Foundation.

Description: Computes the posterior model probabilities for standard meta-analysis models 
    (null model vs. alternative model assuming either fixed- or random-effects, respectively).
    These posterior probabilities are used to estimate the overall mean effect size 
    as the weighted average of the mean effect size estimates of the random- and 
    fixed-effect model as proposed by Gronau, Van Erp, Heck, Cesario, Jonas, & 
    Wagenmakers (2017, <doi:10.1080/23743603.2017.1326760>). The user can define 
    a wide range of non-informative or informative priors for the mean effect size 
    and the heterogeneity coefficient. Moreover, using pre-compiled Stan models, 
    meta-analysis with continuous and discrete moderators with Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow (JZS) 
    priors can be fitted and tested. This allows to compute Bayes factors and 
    perform Bayesian model averaging across random- and fixed-effects meta-analysis 
    with and without moderators. For a primer on Bayesian model-averaged meta-analysis, 
    see Gronau, Heck, Berkhout, Haaf, & Wagenmakers (2020, <doi:10.31234/osf.io/97qup>).

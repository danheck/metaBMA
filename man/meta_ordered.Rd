  0.3), lower = 0), tau = prior("invgamma", c(shape = 1, scale = 0.15)),
  prior = c(1, 1, 1, 1), logml = "integrate", summarize = "stan",

}
\arguments{
\item{y}{effect size per study. Can be provided as (1) a numeric vector, (2)
the quoted or unquoted name of the variable in \code{data}, or (3) a
\code{\link[stats]{formula}} to include discrete or continuous moderator
variables.}

\item{SE}{standard error of effect size for each study. Can be a numeric
vector or the quoted or unquoted name of the variable in \code{data}}

\item{labels}{optional: character values with study labels. Can be a
character vector or the quoted or unquoted name of the variable in
\code{data}}

\item{data}{data frame containing the variables for effect size \code{y},
standard error \code{SE}, \code{labels}, and moderators per study.}

\item{d}{\code{prior} distribution on the average effect size \code{d}. The
prior probability density function is defined via \code{\link{prior}}.}

\item{tau}{\code{prior} distribution on the between-study heterogeneity
\code{tau} (i.e., the standard deviation of the study effect sizes
\code{dstudy} in a random-effects meta-analysis. A (nonnegative) prior
probability density function is defined via \code{\link{prior}}.}

\item{prior}{prior probabilities over models (possibly unnormalized) in the
order \code{c(fixed_H0, fixed_H1, ordered_H1, random_H1)}. Note that the
model \code{random_H0} is not included in the comparison.}

\item{logml}{how to estimate the log-marginal likelihood: either by numerical
integration (\code{"integrate"}) or by bridge sampling using MCMC/Stan
samples (\code{"stan"}). To obtain high precision with \code{logml="stan"},
many MCMC samples are required (e.g., \code{logml_iter=10000, warmup=1000}).}

\item{summarize}{how to estimate parameter summaries (mean, median, SD,
etc.): Either by numerical integration (\code{summarize = "integrate"}) or
based on MCMC/Stan samples (\code{summarize = "stan"}).}

\item{ci}{probability for the credibility/highest-density intervals.}

\item{rel.tol}{relative tolerance used for numerical integration using
\code{\link[stats]{integrate}}. Use \code{rel.tol=.Machine$double.eps} for
maximal precision (however, this might be slow).}

\item{logml_iter}{number of iterations (per chain) from the posterior
distribution of \code{d} and \code{tau}. The samples are used for computing
the marginal likelihood of the random-effects model with bridge sampling
(if \code{logml="stan"}) and for obtaining parameter estimates (if
\code{summarize="stan"}). Note that the argument \code{iter=2000} controls
the number of iterations for estimation of the random-effect parameters per
study in random-effects meta-analysis.}

\item{iter}{number of MCMC iterations for the random-effects meta-analysis.
Needs to be larger than usual to estimate the probability of all random
effects being ordered (i.e., positive or negative).}

\item{silent_stan}{whether to suppress the Stan progress bar.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to \code{rstan::sampling} (see
\code{\link[rstan]{stanmodel-method-sampling}}). Relevant MCMC settings
concern the number of warmup samples that are discarded
(\code{warmup=500}), the total number of iterations per chain
(\code{iter=2000}), the number of MCMC chains (\code{chains=4}), whether
multiple cores should be used (\code{cores=4}), and control arguments that
make the sampling in Stan more robust, for instance:
\code{control=list(adapt_delta=.97)}.}
}
\description{
Computes the Bayes factor for the hypothesis that the true study effects in a
random-effects meta-anaysis are all positive or negative.
}
\details{
Usually, in random-effects meta-analysis,the study-specific random-effects
are allowed to be both negative or positive even when the prior on the
overall effect size \code{d} is truncated to be positive). In contrast, the
function \code{meta_ordered} fits and tests a model in which the random
effects are forced to be either all positive or all negative. The direction
of the study-specific random-effects is defined via the prior on the mode of
the truncated normal distribution \code{d}. For instance,
\code{d=prior("norm", c(0,.5), lower=0)} means that all random-effects are
positive (not just the overall mean effect size).

The posterior summary statistics of the overall effect size in the model
\code{ordered} refer to the the \emph{average/mean} of the study-specific
effect sizes (as implied by the fitted truncated normal distribution) and
\emph{not} to the location parameter \code{d} of the truncated normal
distribution (which is only the mode, not the expected value of a truncated
normal distribution).

The Bayes factor for the order-constrained model is computed using the
encompassing Bayes factor. Since many posterior samples are required for this
approach, the default number of MCMC iterations for \code{meta_ordered} is
\code{iter=5000} per chain.

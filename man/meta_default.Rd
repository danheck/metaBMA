\usage{
meta_default(y, SE, labels, data, field = "psychology", effect = "d", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{effect size per study. Can be provided as (1) a numeric vector, (2)
the quoted or unquoted name of the variable in \code{data}, or (3) a
\code{\link[stats]{formula}} to include discrete or continuous moderator
variables.}

\item{SE}{standard error of effect size for each study. Can be a numeric
vector or the quoted or unquoted name of the variable in \code{data}}

\item{labels}{optional: character values with study labels. Can be a
character vector or the quoted or unquoted name of the variable in
\code{data}}

\item{data}{data frame containing the variables for effect size \code{y},
standard error \code{SE}, \code{labels}, and moderators per study.}

\item{field}{either\code{"psychology"} or \code{"medicine"}}

\item{effect}{the type of effect size used in the meta-analysis: either
Cohen's d (\code{"d"}),
Fisher's z-transformed correlation (\code{"z"}),
or log odds ratios (\code{"logOR"}).}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to \code{\link{meta_bma}}}
}
\description{
Wrapper with default prior for Bayesian meta-analysis.
Since version 0.6.6, the default priors for Cohen's d have been changed from a
normal distribution with scale=0.3 to a Cauchy distribution with scale=0.707.
Moreover, scale adjustments were implemented when using Fisher's z or log odds-ratios.
}
\details{
The prior distribution depends on the scale of the effect size that is used in
the meta-analysis (Cohen's d, Fisher's z, or log odds ratio). To ensure that
the results are comparable when transforming between different effect sizes
(e.g., using the function \code{\link{transform_es}}), it is necessary to
adjust the prior distributions. The present adjustments merely use a linear
re-scaling of the priors to achieve approximately invariant results when
using different types of effect sizes.

\itemize{
\item The distribution of Fisher's z is approximately half as wide as the
distribution of Cohen's d and hence the prior scale parameter is divided by two.
\item The distribution of the log odds ratio is approximately
\code{pi / sqrt(3) = 1.81} times as wide as the distribution of Cohen's d.
Hence, the prior scale parameter is doubled by this factor.
}

For \code{field = "psychology"}, this results in the following defaults:
\itemize{
\item \code{effect = "d"} (Cohen's d): Cauchy distribution with scale=0.707 on the overall
effect size (parameter d) and inverse gamma distribution with shape=1 and
scale=0.15 on the standard deviation of effect sizes across studies (parameter tau).
\item \code{effect = "z"} (Fisher's z): Cauchy distribution with scale=0.354 on d and
inverse gamma with shape=1 and scale=0.075 on tau.
\item \code{effect = "logOR"} (log odds ratio): Cauchy distribution with scale=1.283 on d and
inverse gamma with shape=1 and scale=0.272 on tau.
}

Currently, the same priors are used when specifying \code{field = "medicine"}.

Default prior distributions can be plotted using \code{\link{plot_default}}.
